    <p>HELLO !</p>
    <p>I am <em><strong>CONSTANTINE</strong><em></p>
    <p>and I love to solve problems.
      For the past decade I’ve been helping different businesses to systematize their processes to become more efficient. From financial services to small businesses there were always things to improve. However,  I found that the moment the issue was eradicated and things ran smoothly, there were no more problems left to solve, which isn’t a bad thing, unless you’re  me. 
      After doing some research I found that programming in itself is an ultimate puzzle, as well as, a tool to provide all sort of solutions for an array of issues. 
      Aside from programming, I’m really fond of the topic of longevity. In order to keep my mind and body sharp and healthy there are certain routines that will help me to live as long as I possibly can. 
      These routines include cold showers, exercising, breathing techniques, fasting, clean diet, and meditation. These are some of the main components of a healthy lifestyle. For fun I enjoy playing video games, reading books and watching movies.
